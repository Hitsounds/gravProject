# gravProject
A-level project


Rough Outline:

prototypes

1. Basic interface with inputs, no outputs at this stage other than debugging outputs in console (check with s. for input layout)

2. Display inputed values on a static plot (no simulation just yet)

3. Implement circular simulation
(refer to s. throughout)

4. Implement simulation speed control (test slider and number input with s)

5. Implement value extraction and calculation (refer to s to find out what values need to be calculated and extracted)

6. Implement N-body simulation and method to switch between

7. Make sure value extraction code works with new simulation method

8. Final run through with s

9. Relax
